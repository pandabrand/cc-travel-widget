##Travel Collide Widget Instructions

*jQuery 3.1.1 or higher is required*  
If jQuery is not already added to your site add this line at the end before the `</body>`  
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>  

Next add this right below the jQuery or right before the `</body>`  
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pandabrand/df4532953d0666aeb08c9baadf9e1cfc.js"></script>  


Where you would like the widget to show up add this `div` element  
    <div id="cc-info" data-cc-city="austin"></div>  

The attribute `data-cc-city` will take any of the currently available cities. You will find that list and how the correct attribute value at http://www.collidetravel.com/cc-cities
